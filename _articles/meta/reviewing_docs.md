# Reviewing Contributions to the High Fidelity Documentation

There are two sides (or perhaps more) to reviewing documentation: ensuring the documentation is easy to read, and ensuring a novice reader would be able to easily follow the instructions in the documentation. 

When reviewing (and writing) your documentation, *turn on your spellchecker* and imagine you have only the vaguest idea where anything is in the High Fidelity interface. Actually follow the instructions in the tutorial or article you are reviewing and point out places where, for example, a small hint as to the location of a menu item, would make the document easier to follow.
